abstract = "The predisposition to neuropsychiatric disease involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. However, little is known about how genetic variants impart brain dysfunction or pathology. We use transcriptomic profiling as a quantitative readout of molecular brain-based phenotypes across 5 major psychiatric disorders, including autism (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), depression (MDD), and alcoholism (AAD), compared with carefully matched controls. We identify patterns of shared and distinct gene-expression perturbations across these conditions, including neuronal gene co-expression modules downregulated in ASD, SCZ, and BD, astrocyte modules most prominently upregulated in ASD and SCZ, and microglia and signaling modules specific to ASD and MDD, respectively. Notably, the degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation was strongly related to polygenic (SNP-based) overlap across disorders, suggesting a significant causal genetic component. These findings provide a systems-level view of the neurobiological architecture of major neuropsychiatric illness and demonstrate pathways of molecular convergence and specificity."
