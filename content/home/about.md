# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor-in-Residence in the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at UCLA and the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. Our group uses systems-level, functional genomic approaches to understand the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders.
