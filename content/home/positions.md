The Gandal Lab is expanding! We are looking for highly motivated individuals at all levels of training to join our team.

### Postdocs
We are looking for highly motivated individuals with an MD and/or PhD to lead a project integrating RNAseq from ASD brain with genetic and epigenetic measures to develop an integrative, systems-level view of the molecular neuropathology of disease. Candidates with a background in Genetics, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Bioinformatics, or related fields are encouraged to apply.
Please send a full CV, three professional references, and a brief statement of scientific interest to mgandal@mednet.ucla.edu

### Research staff
We are looking to hire a staff research assistant with a BS in bioinformatics, computer science, or analogous experience to assist in large-scale computational and statistical analyses across multiple projects in the lab. No direct experience is necessary other than proficiency with computing and familiarity with unix. 2+ year commitment is preferred. Research assistants are expected to be co-authors on laboratory manuscripts. Dr. Gandal places a strong emphasis on mentorship, with previous research assistants matriculating into graduate programs at Columbia, NYU, and UCLA, among others.

### Undergraduate Student Researchers
Please contact Dr. Gandal to discuss current opportunities to join the Lab.
