We use microarray and RNA-sequencing technologies to characterize altered patterns of gene expression in post-mortem human brain samples from subjects with neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and alcoholism as well as matched controls. Emerging data indicate a substantial overlap in genetic risk shared across multiple distinct psychiatric disorders. Yet, this finding remains largely unexplained, in part due to a lack of systematic, comparable phenotyping across disorders. We use the transcriptome as a quantitative measurement close to the underlying genetic risk for disease. Our work has identified a clear pattern of shared and distinct gene-expression perturbations across these conditions, including shared neuronal and synaptic pathways downregulated in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, activation of astrocytes in ASD and schizophrenia, and prominent upregulation of microglia in ASD alone. The degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation was strongly related to polygenic overlap across disorders, indicating a significant genetic component. This work provides a systems-level view of the neurobiological architecture of major neuropsychiatric illness and demonstrate pathways of molecular convergence and specificity to inform potential future mechanistic-based interventions.
