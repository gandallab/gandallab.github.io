Funded by the Simons Foundation for Autism Research (SFARI), we are working to integrate RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, and genotyping data from post-mortem human brain samples across 10 cortical regions from subjects with ASD and matched controls, to map in detail the temporal and spatial trajectories of microglial and astrocyte activation in ASD. We are using epigenetic annotations to provide a critical readout of the neuron-to-glia proportion within each sample. Gene co-expression networks will be used to identify specific cellular and molecular pathways disrupted in ASD cortex, which will be integrated with polygenic risk scores to identify potential causal genetic drivers.
