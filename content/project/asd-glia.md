Funded by the Simons Foundation for Autism Research (SFARI), we are working to develop an integrative model for the relationship between polygenic risk for ASD, cellular and molecular changes in microglial and astrocyte populations in ASD brain. We will use measures of RNAseq, DNA methylation, and genotyping data from post-mortem human brain samples across 10 cortical regions from subjects with ASD and matched controls to map in detail the temporal and spatial trajectories of microglial and astrocyte activation in ASD. Epigenetic markers will be used to provide a  readout of the neuron-to-glia proportion within each sample. Gene co-expression networks will be employed to identify specific cellular and molecular pathways disrupted in ASD cortex, which will be integrated with polygenic risk scores to identify potential causal genetic drivers.
