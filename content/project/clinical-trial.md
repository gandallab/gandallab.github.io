Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly disabling, persistent neurodevelopmental disorders. There
are no available treatments for core symptoms of ASD. Consequently, there is tremendous need to develop novel, biologically-informed interventions. Emerging evidence implicates hyperactivity of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), in ASD pathophysiology. However, the functional consequences of microglial activation, and its promise as a therapeutic target, remain unknown. This study seeks to directly interrogate in vivo microglial activation in ASD using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the radiotracer N-(2,5-dimethoxy-benzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-acetamide, labeled with carbon-11 ([11C]-DAA1106), which binds to the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of neuroinflammation and activated microglia.


Adults with ASD and healthy controls will be assessed for baseline differences in [11C]-DAA1106 binding. ASD subjects will then undergo 12 weeks of open-label treatment with minocycline, an FDA-approved antibiotic that blocks microglial activation. [11C]-DAA1106 binding will be measured post-treatment to confirm target engagement, as compared with test-retest assessment in controls. ASD subjects will be evaluated pre- and post-treatment for several secondary and exploratory measures, including clinical global impression (CGI), measures of anxiety and emotion regulation, as well as cognitive control and processing speed. Peripheral cytokine levels will be assessed for correlation with microglial activation.
